# DFLauncher
A simple launcher for Dwarf Fortress on OSX, for those who don't want to manually run the `df` file

## Backstory
I created this launcher to be able to simply run DF from the launchpad, without being forced to go in and find the `df` file every time I wanted to run the game.

## Installation
Just drop `DFLauncher.app` into the same folder `df` resides in (it should be called `df_osx` unless you changed it)
